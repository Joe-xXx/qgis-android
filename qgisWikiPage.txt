This page contains details about Google Summer of Code 2011 project "QGIS mobile"

Here's the [http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/mbernasocchi/14005 project page] on GSoC 2011 site.

I created a public repository on GitHub [https://github.com/mbernasocchi/qgis-mobile].

==Goal==
The idea is to Port QGIS to Android and improve the GUI for using it on a Tablet PC. Qt, the base library of QGIS has already been ported to Android recently under the name Necessitas. A QT libs manager for android already exists as well under the name Ministro.
QGIS mobile should be finally packaged as an .apk pakage for easy distribution.

==Timeline==
===Until midterm===
The first part of the project would be dedicated to get all the other required libraries for building QGIS compiled for Android and to get a standard Qgis running under Android.
===After midterm===
The second part would then be dedicated to the UI improvement (based on a user case?) for using QGIS with a touchscreen interface, this would be a first version of QGIS Mobile.
====GPS integration====
Of utter importance is the integration of the mobile GPS device. This should be implemented using qgsGpsConnection, gpsNmeaConnection and qgsGpsDConnection

===In case of extra time===
A third part, depending on the difficulty of the two first parts (or as part of a future project), would be to create a prototype for an optimized UI for smaller Android devices with basic functionality.

==Libraries Porting==
these libraries need to be ported to Android.

I started creating scripts that do all the work, they are located in the scripts folder of the [https://github.com/mbernasocchi/qgis-mobile/tree/master/scripts github repo]
===proj===
'''Done'''
needs updating config.sub and configuring like this:
 <nowiki>./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR</nowiki>

Installer Script: https://github.com/mbernasocchi/qgis-mobile/blob/master/scripts/proj-4.7.0.sh

===geos===
'''Almost Done'''

Installer Script: https://github.com/mbernasocchi/qgis-mobile/blob/master/scripts/geos-3.2.2.sh
