Changes in 3.0.0

   These are mostly ABI breaking changes.
   In few cases the API also changed, but the most external one
   (the documented one) should be unchanged.

- New things:
	- Added geom::BinaryOp class performing a binary operation
	  using different heuristics to reduce probability of robustness
	  issues. Both C-API and XMLTester now use this class for
	  binary operations.

	- Added overlay::overlayOp() adapter class
	- Added GEOSSimplify() and GEOSTopologyPreserveSimplify()
	  to the C API

	- Ruby interface
	- New ShortCircuitedGeometryVisitor class
	- New operation/predicate package
	- Added CGAlgorithms::isPointInRing() version working with
	  Coordinate::ConstVect type (faster!)

	  anymore, getCoordinatesRO() obsoleted.
	- JTS packages mapped to geos:: sub-namespaces
	- Geometry::getInteriorPoint() returns NULL if called
	  against an EMPTY geom

	  EMPTY geoms
	- GEOSException is now derived by std::runtim_exception
	  and thrown by const reference.
	- Geometry constructors made protected, to force use
	  of a GeometryFactory.

- Correctness:
	- More const-correct signatures
	- Stronger methods typing (removed some void * args).
	- Changed index-related funx signatures to use size_t
	  rather then int
	- More const-correctness in Buffer "package"

	  NULL from getCoordinat() when empty.
	- Use unsigned int for indexes and sizes.

	  w/out name clashes)

	- Moved source/bigtest and source/test to tests/bigtest
	  and test/xmltester
	- Moved C-API in it's own top-level dir capi/
	- Reworked automake scripts to produce a static lib for each subdir
	  and then link all subsystem's libs togheter
	- Renamed DefaultCoordinateSequence to CoordinateArraySequence.
	- Renamed OverlayOp opcodes by prepending the 'op' prefix, and
	  given the enum a name (OpCode) for type-safety.

	  result of overlaying polygons containing touching holes (#13)
	- Fixed integer conversion bug

  	  to reduce construction costs.
	- Changed geomgraph nodeMap to use Coordinate pointers as keys

	  binding options.

	- Changed PlanarGraph::addEdges to take a const vector by ref
	  rathern then a non-const vector by pointer

	  rather then a non-const vector by pointer
